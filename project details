The weather app project utilizes the Python `tkinter` package to build a graphical user interface (GUI). The app prompts the user for input and, upon receiving it,
displays the weather report in a new window with custom GUI modifications. When the new window opens, the homepage is hidden, but users can return to the homepage for another 
search or exit the application. In the background, the `get_weather` function fetches weather data from an online API, processes the relevant information,
and presents it on the weather report window.
